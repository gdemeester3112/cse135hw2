## Echo

I added a Echo Form which shows all the html responses for PHP, Python and Go at the bottom of my website



## Analytics decision

I picked Google Analytics because it seems like something a lot of websites use, so knowing how to set it up would be useful. If I ever need to quickly add analytics to a website in the future, understanding how Google Analytics works will make that a lot easier.



I decided to go for Google Analytics because it was the most popular one and the one I was the most interested about.
